               <p class="content">for all have sinned and come short of
                the glory of God
                no man is righteous of their own we are
                all guilty of sin rebelled against the
                holy God who hates iniquity and demands
                justice
                we all deserve punishment for our sin
                but God so loved the world that He sent
                His Son Jesus Christ to suffer and die
                on the cross on our behalf
                jesus never sinned and lived a perfect
                life of obedience he was crucified for
                our sins and for the sins of the whole
                world three days after his sacrifice God
                raised Jesus Christ from the dead he has
                resurrected the glory and lives for
                evermore the Lord Jesus Christ has been given all
                power and authority he sent out his
                followers to go and make disciples of
                all nations to proclaim the good news
                and to teach others to obey everything
                he commanded them he is now exalted and
                sits at the right hand of God God has
                appointed a day to righteously judge the
                whole world by Jesus Christ whom he has
                ordained we are called to preach the
                gospel and to warn all of mankind to
                repent and be baptized in the name of
                Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
                that you may receive the Holy Ghost by
                grace and through faith we are justified
                and reconciled back to God grace is not
                an excuse to continue in sin but through
                faith God has given us the power to be
                dead to sin the righteousness of every
                man is filthy as rags so that no man can
                boast blessed is the man who forsakes
                his sin and puts trust in the Lord Jesus
                Christ cursed is the man it for sakes
                the faith and puts trust in his own good
                words if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if
                we confess our sins he is faithful and
                just to forgive our sins and to cleanse
                us from all unrighteousness we encourage
                everyone not to sin and if any man does
                sin we have an advocate with our Father
                he is Jesus Christ the righteous one he
                is the propitiation of our sins and not
                only for ours but also for the sins of
                the whole world those who reject the
                Lord Jesus Christ and the message of his
                mercy will be rejected on the great day
                of judgment</p>
